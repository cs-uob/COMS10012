# COMS10012 Software Tools

Welcome to the website for COMS10012 Software Tools, running in Teaching Block 2, spring 2021. This unit will run entirely online.

_This unit page is for the **undergraduate** version of the unit. There is a simplified unit with a similar name on the conversion MSc (COMSM0085 Overview of Software Tools) that shares material with this unit, but MSc students should not be using this page unless their unit director tells them to. **MSc students must not attend the labs for this unit or contact the staff on this unit** but must use the labs for the MSc version of the unit instead._

## Unit Organisation

This unit is worth 20 credit points, which is one third of your second teaching block. Each week is structured into two activities, each one containing around 2h of lectures that have been split into several shorter videos where possible. (In a normal year a 10CP unit has 2 lectures/week, and we're doing double that.) Each activity also comes with a set of exercises and a 2-hour lab.

This unit's main aim is to prepare you for the second-year unit COMS20006 Software Engineering Project, where you work in groups to solve a real problem for a real client using software. Many of the technologies you learn in this unit are ones that most groups will use in their 2nd year projects. There is also material in this unit that is relevant for the 2nd year units COMS20008 Computer Systems A (concurrency) and COMS20009 Computer Systems B (operating systems, security).

This unit has an attendance and engagement hurdle, like Mathematics A from TB1: you must attend at least 75% of the labs and engage with their exercises. See the [attendance policy](attendance.md) for details.
