# Overview

This page contains the exercises for Part 1 (the first 5 weeks) of COMS10012 Software Tools.
Weeks usually contain two workbooks, and each workbook has associated videos to
watch before the lab (on the main page for each workbook) as well as a set of
practical exercises which you'll tackle before and during the lab.

Part 1 focuses on tools for setting up systems and writing code. We'll start
with system administration tasks (like connecting to machines via ssh and
updating software) and then move on to making good use of Unix tools,
progressing to shell scripting and how to automate or simplify tasks you might
encounter as a developer. Then we'll look at tools you can use to support
programming in several different languages, including version control and
debuggers. Finally, we'll cover how you can store structured information
effectively in a relational database, and write queries to interact with that
database.
