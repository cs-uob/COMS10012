## Readings

This week, we are doing react, so the readings are the [official react guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), main concepts 1-7. If you have time you can read up to 10 and if you are particularly interested in React, all 12 of the "main concepts" pages.

React has a separate [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) which we will not be using for this unit, but as a complement to the workshops if you are particularly interested then you could look at this as well.
