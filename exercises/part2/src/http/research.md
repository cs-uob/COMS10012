# HTTP/URL research exercises

Research online what the following are and what they do:

  - The _fragment_ part of a URL.
  - The `Accept` header sent by the HTTP client.
  - The `User-agent` header sent by the HTTP client. What does your browser send?
  - How do you encode a path that contains a space in an URL? Which other characters are "special" and need to be treated this way in paths?
  - Which web server is the University of Bristol using for `www.bristol.ac.uk`, according to the headers? Read up online on this server and the organisation of the same name that maintains it.
